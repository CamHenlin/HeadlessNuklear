# Headless Nuklear

Headless version of Nuklear (https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear) that takes event strings over standard input, and returns drawing commands over standard output. Heavily adapted from https://github.com/CamHenlin/nuklear-quickdraw

The intent here is that this should provide the lowest-possible bandwidth way of running a UI

May need a bit of further tweaking to support all Nuklear commands but is overall working.
